        <p>Journey through the Lands Between, a new fantasy world created by Hidetaka Miyazaki, creator of the infl uential DARK SOULS video game series, and George R. R. Martin, author of The New York Times best-selling fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire. Unravel the mysteries of the Elden Ringâ€™s power. Encounter adversaries with profound backgrounds, characters with their own unique motivations for helping or hindering your progress, and fearsome creatures.</p>
        <p>If you're familiar with FromSoftware's previous titles, such as the Dark Souls trilogy, Bloodborne, or Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, then you can look forward to the ideas and gameplay choices from these games in a world unlike any you've seen before.</p>

        <header>Choosing Your Class</header>
        <p>There are many ways that you can approach the Lands Between. Huge swords, precise bows, sorceries, incantations, elemental magic, and so much more await.</p>
        <p>The first step to choosing how you'll tackle the challenges in front of you is through picking your starting class. Each class comes with a different allocation of stats, and while there are ways later on to change your stat allocations, you can never undo the class-specific starting stats after creating your character. Because of this, it is best to have at least some idea of the type of character you want to end up with.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="classTitle">Hero</span>: a Strength-based class that begins the game with an axe.</li>
          <li><span class="classTitle">Bandit</span>: a dangerous bandit who strikes for weak points. Excels at ranged combat with bows.</li>
          <li><span class="classTitle">Astrologer</span>: a scholar who reads fate in the stars. Heir to the school of glintstone sorcery.</li>
          <li><span class="classTitle">Warrior</span>: a twinblade wielding warrior from a nomadic tribe. An origin of exceptional technique.</li>
          <li><span class="classTitle">Confessor</span>: a church spy adept at covert operations. Equally adept with a sword as they are with incantations.</li>
          <li><span class="classTitle">Wretch</span>: as poor, purposeless, and naked as the day they were born. A nice club is all they have.</li>
          <li><span class="classTitle">Vagabond</span>: a knight exiled from their homeland to wander. A solid, armor-clad origin.</li>
          <li><span class="classTitle">Prophet</span>: a seer ostracized by inauspicious prophecies. Well versed in healing incantations.</li>
          <li><span class="classTitle">Samurai</span>: a capable fighter from the distant land of reeds. Handy with Katana and Longbows.</li>
        </ul>

        <code>R2/RT: Heavy attack</code><br>
        <code>L1/LB: Block (or dual-wield attack if power-stancing)</code><br>

        <header>Where To Go First</header>
        <p>As you start the game, you will emerge into Limgrave, a relatively peaceful area far from the base of the Erdtree. There is plenty to do in Limgrave, and making sure you explore every hill and valley of it before moving on is not a bad idea.</p>
        <p>Two things you will want to do before anything else though are meeting Melina and gaining access to Torrent, your spectral steed. To do this, follow the guidance of grace to each new site of lost grace until you are gifted Torrent from Melina.</p>
        <p>After finding everything there is to do in Limgrave (don't worry if you can't defeat every boss quite yet), you can go in 3 directions.</p>
        <p>To the south lies the Weeping Peninsula, a side-area that isn't requied to enter into for the main story, which makes it a perfect place to go if you want to explore some more and power up through experience/new gear.</p>
        <p>To the northwest lies Stormveil Castle, home of Godrick the Grafted. You can actually temporarily bypass this castle. Tackling Stormveil after exploring Limgrave is the most conventional approach to the game, and this will set you nicely down the path of progresing the main story. You can also make your way into Liurnia of the Lakes if you feel extra-adventurours. </p>
        <p>If you are really up to a challenge, you can choose to head northeast and take on Caelid. Filled with pools of scarlet rot and not-necessarily-early-game enemeies, this path is not typically advised as your first departure from Limgrave, unless you know what you're getting into.</p>
